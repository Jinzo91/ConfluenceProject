# Web application project for the SAP course at TUM
Front end: Javascript & SAP UI5
Back end: Python, Flask & MongoDB

In this project, we are trying to implement features like automated tagging based on documents and natural-language-processing methods.
Another feature is the search function, which allows to search for documents, tags or dates inside a local databse.
