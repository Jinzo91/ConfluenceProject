#Web application project for the SAP course at TUM
Written with Javascript & SAP UI5 and Python & Flask.
In this project, we are trying to implement features like automated tagging based on documents and natural-language-processing methods.
Another feature is the search function, which allows to search for documents, tags or dates inside a local databse.
We are using SAP UI5 as a front end interface. For back end we use Python and MongoDB.
